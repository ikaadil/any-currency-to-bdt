      # Scrapling StealthyFetcher (Ria, MoneyGram) uses Playwright/patchright with Chromium
      # (see https://github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling). We do not run `scrapling install` here
      # because it downloads Camoufox from api.github.com, which often times out in CI.
      # The Chromium installed above is sufficient for Scrapling's fetchers.
